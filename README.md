## Using Child Process to process millions of data

In this project I am using the child process module together with Node.js Streams to create 3 parallel processes responsible for processing 1 million data each

Run the `npm run seed` command to generate the data to be processed
Run the `npm start` command to process the data and validate that everything was executed correctly
